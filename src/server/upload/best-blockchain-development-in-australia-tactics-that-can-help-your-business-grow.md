Blockchain can be defined as it is the database of the distributed ledger that can store the data accurately and this can be done by using the cryptographic technique It is an expanding program of records known as blocks. Each Block contains public and private and the transaction data and a time stamp. Each block is connected to each other and every block contains the address of the previous block. This public ledger records transaction between two people enduringly in blocks. Once a transaction has been filed, the data within an appropriate block cannot be changed without altering other succeeding blocks. Even after the approval of the majority of the network is needed to perform the change.
Various Fields Where Blockchain Technology can be Implemented:

Blockchain technology is not restricted only to the circle of the economic sector. There are many cases where Blockchain technology has been efficiently used by various countries for various plans. Following are the main areas where this Technology can be used:

* Banking Sector
* Financial Institutes
* Insurance Sectors
* Media and Entertainment Sector
* Government and Public Sector
* Healthcare and Life science sector
* Retail and E-Commerce Sector
* Automotive Sector and more.

## Advantages of blockchain technology for businesses:

Main advantages of Blockchain technology are decentralization, immutability, safety, and accuracy.

1. The blockchain technology provides for affirmation without having to be reliant on third-party like a bank.

2. The data arrangement in a blockchain is stored only. So, the data cannot be altered or eliminated.

3. It uses preserved cryptography to defend the data ledgers. Also, modern ledger is dependent on its adjacent ended block to complete the cryptography method.

4. All the activities and data are attached to the block after the process of most trust confirmation. There is an agreement of all the ledger members on what is to be entered in the block.

5. The tracks are recorded in consecutive order. Therefore, all the blocks in the blockchain are time stamped.

6. The record is shared across every single node in the blockchain who are the associates. So, it is distributed.
The transactions saved in the blocks are held in millions of computers joining in the chain. Therefore it is  Known as the decentralized system. So, therefore, data cannot be deleted once entered in the block.

7. The transactions that take place are clear. The people who are provided authorization can view the activity.
The source of any ledger can be traced along the chain to its point of entry.

As numerous consensus rules are required to confirm the record, it eliminates the chance of duplicate record or scam.
With the smart contracts, the businesses can pre-set restrictions on the blockchain. The automated transactions are triggered only when the requirements are met.

## How Blockchain Can be Useful For Business. 

TRANSPARENCY
In a distributed ledger every activity is registered openly. Public verifiability enables anyone to confirm correct system operating. 
IMMUTABILITY
A third-party cannot perform any modifications to the system.
NO INTERMEDIARY 
peer-to-peer and business-to-business transactions are Possible here without any third parties. 
INTEGRITY
Each and Everything is archived and approved in a decentralized way and the system guarantees that data is treated in a safe and transparent way. 
SECURITY
With no central point to be appropriated the system is shielded versus hacking attacks and scam.
 CUSTOMER CENTRICITY 
Transparent solutions allow to streamline and automate conversation with clients, allowing also greater belief level.

INNOVATION 
Totally modern business patterns that blockchain proposes may lead to principal competitive benefits.
