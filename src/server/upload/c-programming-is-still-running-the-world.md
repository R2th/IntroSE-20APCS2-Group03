The C language is probably older most of its users. It first came into being in 1972, when the UNIX operating system started developing. The main objective of its creation was to achieve the tasks with minimum lines of code. Next, in 1977, the development of the Oracle database began and the code was finally rewritten in C in 1983. Right now, it is indeed one of the most popular databases in use. Finally, in 1985, the world saw the rise of Windows. Windows 1.0 came into being and experts state that the kernel was written in C. (Note: the source code of Windows 1.0 is not publicly accessible). The development of the Linux kernel began in 1991 and it relied heavily on C language as well. In 1992, it became a part of the GNU operating system. 

There might be a plethora of computer languages existent today, but C is the king of them all. It is the most popular and widely used languages in the world. Right now, you will come across multiple OSx and microcontrollers that run on C. Some of the most advanced scientific systems and complex operating systems use it in their source code. Since it is the most widely accepted computer language, it has helped in the globalization of many critical technologies. Even when the multiple users or developers do not share the same verbal language, they can understand each other’s ideas in C. 

## Where can you find the contributions of the language in your life?##

Saying that the world is powered by C is not overstating its utility in the modern world. Some of the most widely used operating systems today use this language. In fact, you could say the millions enjoy the benefits of [C language programming](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-c/) without realizing it every day of their lives. 

### Microsoft Windows###

Although the source code of Windows is still not publicly available, it is common knowledge that the kernel is written in C. World’s favourite operating system with about 90% of the OSx-market share is currently running on a C language-based kernel. 

### Mobile###

We use smartphones to get updates on the world, but little do most of us know that it is powered by C as well. iOS, Windows and Android kernels draw their (seemingly) endless power from C language-based kernels as well. Well, figuring it out is easy for those who know that they run on the mobile adaptations of Linux, Mac OS and Windows. 

### Linux###

Since its beginning Linux has shared a close relationship with C. Did you know? Today, about 97% of the world’s 500 most powerful computers are powered by the Linux kernel we mentioned in the beginning. You might even be using it on your personal computer right now. 

### Databases###

Multiple leading databases use C language. You have either used one, or at least heard of some of the most popular ones that do. Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server use C. Oracle, MySQL and MS SQL Server use both C and C++. All kinds of websites and systems including finance, media, entertainment, education, health, retail and social networking use these databases.

### 3D movies###

Interestingly, most 3D movies begin with applications that are base on C and C++. Since C has made it possible to execute standard tasks with fewer lines of code, the need for fast and efficient applications is satiated by these C-based applications. During the creation, 3D movies need to go through extensive processing that involves mammoth volumes of data. These C-language applications can handle the processing of the data at lightning fast speed. They actually help save a fortune by hastening the processing and rendering the process. 

### Embedded systems###

Are you thinking of setting your alarm clock 20 minutes late so you can grab some extra shuteye? The alarm clock is powered by C. so is the coffeemaker and the microwave, which are all embedded systems? In fact, all embedded systems you come across on a daily basis including your washing machine, dishwasher, digital camera, car alarm, air conditioning and your TV are powered by C.  In short, even if you are not a programmer or a daily computer user, you have made your acquaintance with C without really knowing it. And if you ever want to escape coming across anything powered by C, you will literally have to crawl inside a cave and live there forever. 

## Why do we love C programming so much?## 

We love C due to its diversity and flexibility. It is the Captain Marvel of all [programming languages](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming-language). There is nothing C cannot do. In fact, if there is something that no other programming language can do, you should give it a try. There might be more complex and more powerful languages that allow the programmers to access built-in libraries for simplifying the development process, but C programming has a nascent charm that is impossible to deny. The wide acceptance of C has added to the simplicity of the total development process. A greater part of the world is currently running on C and it is quite impossible to replace the perfectly running systems with something else that is complex and less popular.
