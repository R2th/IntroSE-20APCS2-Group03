> Robotics Knee Replacement Surgery – Unparalled precision for pain relief and a normal life

Arthritis is a common cause of hip and knee pain. It can be degenerative (osteoarthritis), inflammatory (rheumatoid, lupus), post-traumatic or due to a vascular necrosis (lack of blood to the bone).

[Hip and knee replacement surgery](http://amandeephospital.org/joint-replacement-hospital-amritsar/)are performed once patients have exhausted non-operative treatment. These surgeries are traditionally done with help of bone cutting guides, but today, the most advanced robotic assisted technology for [knee replacement surgery ](http://amandeephospital.org/knee-replacement-hospital-amritsar/)is a novel alternative to conventional surgical techniques.

During knee replacement surgery, there are multiple surgical variables that are manually controlled by the[ orthopedic surgeon](http://amandeephospital.org/knee-replacement-hospital-amritsar/). The challenge of aligning the implants and preparing the bones to accept it can be complex, invasive and time consuming as no two knee joints are exactly the same.

Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery

The robotic system is designed to help the surgeon not only plan the surgery based on a patient’s unique anatomy, but also position the total knee implant using a combination of computer and robotic assistance.

[Robotic knee replacement surgery](http://amandeephospital.org/robotic-knee-joint-replacement-surgery/) allows the surgeon to collect patient-specific data during the procedure to build a 3D model of the patient’s knee to help plan the surgery. During the procedure, a handheld robotics assisted tool is used to position the specific cut guides exactly as intended, based on the patient-model.

“What we see now is this is providing sub-millimeter, sub-degree accuracy, and there’s no way that with hand-held instruments — a saw — that we normally use that we can achieve that” said Dr. Avtar Singh, Head of Department of Orthopedics at Amandeep Hospital.

“The robot gives me the right kind of information to make the surgery as precise and accurate as possible. Another added advantage is that it creates virtual boundaries on the bone surface. This means, if I try to deviate from the plan either intentionally or unintentionally, the robot will not let me cut any other structure than the damaged bone.” he added.

Robotic technology in knee replacement is known to decrease blood loss, speed up recovery, improve knee function greatly, and helps the patient get back to their normal life much quicker.

Dr. Avtar Singh at[ Amandeep Hospital ](http://www.amandeephospital.org/)is one of the early adopters of this proven technology which was introduced in India just over a year ago. The NAVIO Robotics Surgical System although relatively new in India has over 150 installations in the USA with close to 20,000 surgeries already performed.

“We have the best technology available for patients in India itself. Our aim at Amandeep is to always offer the best quality of care to the patients. Each patient deserves the gift of pain free movement” said Dr. Avtar Singh.
