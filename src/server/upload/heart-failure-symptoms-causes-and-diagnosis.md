With rising standards of living and ever increasing luxuries being embedded in our lives, problems too are rising though at a gradual pace.The problems so rising are now being known as the silent invaders which do not show their effects in initial stages but can even suck the lives out of the bodies drop by drop if not uprooted at the right time.

   One of the top grossing problems popping up these days is the [heart failure](http://dranuragsharma.in/heart-failure-symptoms-causes-diagnosis.html). Now don’t get confused with heart failure to be stoppage in functioning of heart. It basically is a condition in which the heart cannot pump efficiently enough to meet the body’s need for blood. Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean the heart has failed completely. Heart does not pump enough blood. Blood backs up in veins and body does not get enough blood, food, and oxygen.

As it has been told, such problems are silent invaders which do not show any signs at time of entering the body. But still, some symptoms could be identified to deal with the problem before it is too late.Some of the symptoms are:
