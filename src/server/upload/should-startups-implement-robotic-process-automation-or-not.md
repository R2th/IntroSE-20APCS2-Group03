## Data Processing & Data simulations
Many startups and product managers have access to a large amount of data but don't quite have the means to take full advantage of it. Through the use of robotic process automation tools, you have access to several different use cases from the data captured.

Process mining allows you to get a better knowledge of all the steps that go into an action that RPA implementation is completing. Once you automate something with the usage of RPA, you could then split it down into one-of-a-kind stages and steps and find the regions where you could be more efficient and conserve extra time.

Process simulations will let you feed information into a computer, then have it complete the assignment. You can experiment with unusual ways to finish the project and see which method is most efficient while not having to really do it in real life. This is an excellent way for the startup and product managers to discover the maximum efficient way to do things, and doubtlessly alternate it on the fly, if needed.

## Data Management

RPA consulting is of remarkable use to the data field, as it may make "records cleansing, normalization, and introduction or updating of metadata greater efficient."

Data entry is one in every of the maximum repetitive tasks of all and has a high fee of error. By the usage of RPA implementation to automate facts access, you may automatically screen for irregularities in the information, move facts between different storage areas, do away with duplicate statistics, and greater.
