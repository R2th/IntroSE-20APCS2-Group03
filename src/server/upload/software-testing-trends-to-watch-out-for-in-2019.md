With the advent of Agile and DevOps development technologies, the software development industry is undergoing major disruptions. This has lead to the evolution of new testing approaches.  The Quality Assurance professionals have to rapidly adapt to the changes in the software testing industry to stay relevant. Here is a list of 10 software testing trends to watch out for in 2019 !![](https://images.viblo.asia/8f930fd9-6ad5-404f-bf76-c319eba88814.png)

### 1. Digital Transformation with Agile
Businesses are undergoing digital transformation ever since data has become valuable in gaining insights. The latest addition to this trend is the adoption of agile methodology to undergo a digital transformation.  Agile methodology helps to align digital transformation initiatives with business needs.
 
The agile team defines the business challenges, objectives and use cases.  In the agile approach, new features are delivered incrementally with each sprint.  As digital transformation is an ongoing process, agile helps to deliver valuable outcomes frequently for the business rather than waiting for a long time.

### 2. Machine learning in Testing
Machine learning is bringing about revolutionary changes in workflows and processes. In testing, machine learning can be used for:
Test suite optimization – To identify redundant and unique test cases.
Predictive analytics – To predict the key parameters of software testing processes on the basis of historical data.
Log analytics – To identify the tests cases which need to be executed automatically.
Traceability – Extracting keywords from the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to achieve test coverage.
Defect analytics – To identify high-risk areas of the application for the prioritization of regression test cases.

### 3. Increasing Adoption of DevOps
In DevOps, the testing begins at the beginning of the development cycle. This development approach facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This allows testers to perform Continuous Testing and Continuous Monitoring to validate that the developers have built the right application.  The functionality and performance of the application are tested continuously along with development.
 
The testing team aligns the test design, test automation, and test case development with DevOps to not only verify the code changes but ensure that the changes don’t break the product.

### 4. Big Data Testing
Big Data is the high volume of data generated at a high velocity. In Big Data testing, testers have to verify that terabytes of data are successfully processed using commodity cluster and other supportive components. This type of testing focuses on performance testing and functional testing.
The quality of data is also a critical factor in big data testing. The quality of data is verified before the testing begins. The data quality is checked on the basis of various characteristics such as conformity, accuracy, consistency, validity, duplication, data completeness, etc.

### 5. IoT Testing
There are more connected devices than ever before as IoT (Internet of Things) technology is gaining traction. IoT testing is conducted to test IoT technology based devices. The various types of testing for IoT systems are as follows:
Usability Testing – To test the usability of an IoT system
 
Compatibility Testing – To check the compatibility of devices in IoT system
Reliability & Scalability Testing – Simulation of sensors utilizing virtualization tools
Data Integrity Testing – To validate the integrity of data
Security testing – To validate the user authentication process and data privacy controls
Performance Testing –  To test the performance of the connected devices in an IoT network.

### 6. Performance Engineering
Performance engineering will replace performance testing in 2019.  Rather than executing performance test scripts, the focus will be on analyzing how all the elements of the system work together.  The various elements of the system include performance, security, usability, hardware, software, configuration, business value and the customer.  The performance engineering is all about collaborating and iterating on the items of highest value and delivering these items quickly to ensure a high-quality product. Performance engineering will help in exceeding customer expectations in 2019.

### 7. Test Automation
The test automation helps the testing team to focus their time and efforts on creating test cases rather than managing testing needs. Test automation helps to track and manage all testing needs, the types of testing required along with the test coverage. Test automation helps to ensure high- quality software is delivered.
Specialized tools are used to control the execution of tests to compare the actual results against the expected results. Mainly the regression tests which require repetitive actions are automated.  Automation tools are used for both functional and non-functional testing.

### 8. Combining Manual and Automated Testing
More and more quality assurance professionals are using a combination of manual and automated testing approaches to harness the benefits of both as well as to overcome their respective shortcomings. The manual testing is still dominating the testing industry. Although automated testing brings about efficiency in the testing process there are still certain areas such as usability and design which requires manual efforts.

### 9. Shortening Delivery Cycle
Rapid changes in technologies, platforms, and devices are putting pressure on software development teams to deliver the finished products faster and more frequently. Testing needs to be integrated with development to facilitate delivery. Software organizations are ready to invest more in improving their development and delivery processes by employing the right set of tools. The need for test management tools will increase to match up with shortening delivery cycles.

### 10. Integration
With shortening delivery cycles, there is a greater need for integration of various elements of a product development. To facilitate smart testing and analytics, the data is collected from disparate sources such as requirement management systems, change control systems, task management systems, and test environment. This implicates that there is a need for integrated tools which help in requirement management, task management, bug tracking and test management. The integrated tool act as a repository of data of different modules that can be shared and used.


### **Conclusion**
To stay ahead of the curve, the QA professionals’ needs to stay updated on the latest testing trends. The only way to be immune to the disruptions in the software industry is to prepare for the future. The above-mentioned software trends will help testers in investing their time and efforts in acquiring the rights skills and tools for 2019.
