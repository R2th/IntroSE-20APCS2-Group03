**Overview of Mobile Application Testing**

Mobile testing or mobile application testing is a process performed to test the functionality, consistency and usability of an application software specially developed for different handheld devices and to support their operating systems, such as iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows, etc. A thorough mobile testing process ensures that an application must best suit all the characteristics of a mobile device such as hardware & software capability, physical dimension, connectivity capability, etc.

Overviewing these mobile testing interview questions and answers for experienced as well as individuals and the other crucial factors mentioned here can be extremely result oriented for candidates and new learners to this niche.

For mobile application testing, these are the few primary testing procedures mostly performed:

* Functional Testing
* Performance Testing
* Memory Leakage Testing
* Installation Testing
* Security Testing
* Black Box Testing
* Load Testing
* Usability Testing

For those who are looking for Android Mobile Testing Interview Questions, we have also included some of the questions for them. Go through it.

The mobile app testers either use a real device or an Emulator/Simulator for the application testing process. Both have their unique benefits, such as using a real device for mobile testing can benefit with faster processing and most accurate results, whereas using an Emulator/Simulator can be cost-effective, less latency, user-friendly, but also gets low-reliability score due to its deniability to stimulate all types of user interactions. Mobile application testing can be performed with both automation and manual modes.

To get into complete detail of mobile testing, we are mentioning some of the important [Mobile Testing Interview Questions](https://www.bestinterviewquestion.com/mobile-testing-interview-questions). Go through the questions as they will help to you.

Advantages of Using Mobile Testing

* Boosts the quality of application & and receive an optimal opex model with cloud technology
* Accurately gauge the application behaviours with the use of real device mobile testing
* Receive low investment and best-targeted time-to-market with simulator testing
* Better customer satisfaction, quality assurance and high level of security for mobile app

In below, we are explaining a set of most anticipated mobile testing interview questions and answers for your acknowledgement, best suited for both experienced and freshers.



**Ques. 1.List out the absolute best robotized portable testing devices accessible today.**

Portable application analyzers fundamentally utilize two sorts of robotized instruments, 

Item based versatile testing instruments 

Picture based versatile testing apparatuses 

Jama arrangement and Ranorex are two of the best article based portable testing apparatuses, while RoutinBot, Sikuli and Egg Plant can be named as best accessible picture based versatile testing devices for our utilization. 

**Ques. 2.What are the sections of the Android testing structure?**

The android testing structure incorporates an absolute number of three sections: 

Application Package 

Instrumentation TestRunner 

Test Package 

**Ques. 3.Mention couple of best practices for Android testing.**

All the experiments ought to be put away together source code 

While composing the code, designers ought to set up the experiments in the meantime. 

Analyzers ought to evade established emulators and gadgets. 

Each time the code changed, utilization of consistent reconciliation and test execution is essential. 

**Ques. 4.What are the normal bugs found while versatile testing? Give a few models.**

We, analyzers work to discover four kinds of normal bugs; basic, square, minor and major. To model there, a telephone framework crash when testing a specific element of the gadget will be named a basic bug. The GUI bugs will be sorted as minor bugs, and useful handicap of a specific component will be submitted to a noteworthy bug list. Certain execution inaccessibility through the gadget is ON will fall into the square bug list. 

**Ques. 5.How A/B testing is performed for an iOS application?**

The A/B testing for an iOS application incorporates three stages, which are: 

Arrange a test: Preparation of two renditions of focused iOS application and the test metric 

Test: Simultaneous trial of the two forms 

Examine: Measure and investigate the reaction to discharge the better form 

**Ques. 6.What is a Robo-electric testing system?**

The testing on Android Testing Framework for gadget or emulators is troublesome, and here and there may require a great deal of advancement exertion to run and construct an experiment, A Robo-electric system will enable analyzers to run Android test straightforwardly on JVM with no need of emulator or genuine gadget. 

**Ques. 7.Explain the real criteria that an analyzer should think about while performing start to finish portable testing.**

The criteria rundown will be as following: 

Establishment 

The dispatch of the application without system 

Application introduction on the off chance that it underpins 

Application un-establishment 

Application reaction testing 

Application execution testing on different gadgets and system situation 

**Ques. 8.List a couple of normal barricades for an analyzer with utilization of distributed computing for testing.** 

* High costing 

* Lock-in 

* Issues with web availability 

* Membership display 

* Tedious and picture based mechanization 

The system constraint while performing computerization 

**Ques. 9.What does versatile security testing incorporate?**

Test for multi-client backing of utilization without information impedance between them 

Encryption and unscrambling strategy utilized for touchy information correspondence 

Test for application put away document access by any unapproved clients 

Trial of delicate regions in application to avert section of pernicious substance. 

**Ques. 10.What is Port Testing?** 

Port testing is performed to test a solitary usefulness on various gadgets with various stages. There are two classifications for this, Device Testing and Platform Testing.
