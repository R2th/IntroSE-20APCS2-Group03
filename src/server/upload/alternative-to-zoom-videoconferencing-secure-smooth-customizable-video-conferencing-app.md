In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and institutions across industries have moved operations online. Conferences and team meetings have also received the same treatment, in turn shining the spotlight on video calling applications. However, it seems that in the face of easy communication, security and privacy seem to have taken a hit. A living example of this is the Zoom video conferencing software, which grew in popularity only to be hit with reports of data leaks and lack of security.  

The Zoom video calling app and, in general, all videoconferencing applications have been hauled up both internally and externally to ensure the safety and privacy of the users. Zoom’s video conferencing challenges, according to news reports, included:

*  Zoombombers entering video calls unauthorised
* Phishermen hacking into user systems
* User demographics being leaked to advertisers
* Private data being exposed by those with ill intent

Any video conferencing app worth its salt must ensure end-to-end encryption of calls and compliance with privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. 

For those looking to either build an app like Zoom, source a **Zoom video conferencing AP** or find a **Zoom alternative** for your company,   Here are other popular video conference platforms from some big-name brands.
