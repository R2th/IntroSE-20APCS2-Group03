1. Waterfall Model
This model is the simplest of all the models, and therefore, more common among software developers and testers in the industry. The waterfall model is based on a sequence of stages of development that has to be completed before reaching the final goal.
2. V Model
Largely regarded as an upgrade on the waterfall model, the design is in the form of a V (downhill and uphill). In the V model both software development and testing are executed simultaneously, every unit is tested until the final compilation stage.
3. Agile Model
The agile model is designed on the foundation of adaptability. This model is highly suited for complex projects where various teams have to work together.
4. Spiral Model
The Spiral model is similar to the Agile model in its flexibility but pays special attention to risk analysis. The model has four stages which are planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.
5. Rational Unified Process
This model also has four different phases, which are organized into several separate iterations.
6.Rapid application development
The rapid application development model is also called a RAD model.it is another most important type of agile development
