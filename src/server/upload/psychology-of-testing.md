In Waterfall, V-Model, Double V-Model and Agile, There are always a lot of testing involved.
<br><br>
We can always question "**why we need to test?**". Most common answers to this question are:
* To find defects
* Build confidence in software under test
* Assess quality of software
* Reduce failure costs
* Prove that the software conforms to user requirements / functional specifications

<br><br>
But, here is another question that we should also think about. "**Can testing prove that a software is correct?**".
<br><br>
> It is not possible to prove the system has no defects, It is only possible to prove system has defects.

<br><br>
The purpose of testing is to build confidence that the system is working. But, the purpose of testing is also to find defects, and finding defects destroys confidence. So, **Is the purpose of testing to destroy confidence?**
<br><br>
We can have an analogy here. How does the Apple or Samsung say that the phone that they are developing is waterproof? 
*They can prove it by putting the phone under water and check it's limitations*. 

<br><br>

**This is a paradox. The Paradox of Testing.**

> The best way to build confidence is to try and destroy it.

<br><br>
**A good tester should have the following qualities:**

* Methodical and systematic
* Good interpersonal skills to communicate defects information
* Good written, verbal communication skills 
* Experienced in error guessing
* Develop good relationship with developers through collaboration
* Requires a critical eye, attention to detail and curiosity
