# WHAT is API?
The API (Application Programming Interface) can be understood simply as the middleware between the client and the server allowing them to talk to each other.
The reasons to test an API:
1. Make sure the API works.
2. Make sure the API returns what it should do.
3. Make sure security.
4. Make sure your API works on devices, browsers and operating systems.
5. Find out all the ways users can mess things up
6. Make sure the API provides complete functionality that makes it easy. Easily expand applications in the future as new business needs arise.
# API Testing Tools
* The three most widely used API test-tools are: Postman, Curl and SoapUI.
* Postman is a powerful tool used to test web services. It was developed to send HTTP requests simply and quickly.
* Curl is a command-line tool used to deliver requests over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP, DTP, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, RTSP.
* SoapUI is a free tool that is used to test SOAP and RESTful Web Services.

But with these tools is complicated, download and need time to learn how to use. So I will introduce you to a web-based tool that makes it easy to test your API quickly and easily.
# [API TEST](https://w3webtool.com/api-test) Online
Right now, I will introduce you to an online tool that will help you test your http requests quickly.

You access https://w3webtool.com/api-test to use this tool online.

For example, for you to use (or you can go to the help section of the tool for instructions), I will use a simple api to test online.

http://ip-api.com/json/ this is an api URL, with the GET method when sending a request to this API, returns a JSON string containing information about your IP address.

The result will be returned:
