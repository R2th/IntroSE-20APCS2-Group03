Hi các bạn, lâu lắm rồi mình mới lại viết về chủ đề ISTQB. Hôm nay mình chia sẻ với các bạn bộ 10 câu hỏi ôn thi nhé, chúc các bạn ôn luyện thật tốt. Nếu các bạn đã nắm được 70% kiến thức lý thuyết thì đảm bảo sẽ làm được 8/10 câu rồi. Có gì thắc mắc hãy comment bên dưới để mình cùng trao đổi nha ^^

01. The most visible part of testing is test execution. But to be effective and efficient, test
plans should also include time to be spent on planning the tests, designing test cases,
preparing for execution and evaluating results. Which of the following is a major task of test
planning? [K1]

○ Preparing test specifications

○ Evaluating exit criteria and reporting

○ Determining the test approach.

○ Measuring and analyzing results

-> Đáp án: C

02. Seven Testing Principles is a number of testing principles have been suggested over
the past 40 years and offer general guidelines common for all testing. Which one of the
following descriptions about seven testing principles is FALSE? [K2]

○ Testing everything is not feasible except for trivial cases. Instead of exhaustive
testing, risk analysis and priorities should be used to focus testing efforts

○ Testing effort shall be focused proportionally to the expected and later observed
defect density of modules

○ Finding and fixing defects does not help if the system built is unusable and does
not fulfill the user’s needs and expectations

○ Testing can show that defects are present, and can prove that there are no defects

-> Đáp án: D

03. A certain degree of independence (avoiding the author bias) often makes the tester
more effective at finding defects and failures. Independence is not, however, a
replacement for familiarity, and developers can efficiently find many defects in their own
code. Which of the following is the lowest level of independence? [K1]

○ Tests designed by the person(s) who wrote the software under test with the low
level of independence

○ Tests designed by a person(s) from an outsourcing or certification by an external
body

○ Tests designed by a person(s) from an independent test team or performance test
specialists

○ Tests designed by another person(s) from development team

-> Đáp án: A

04. A certain degree of independence (avoiding the author bias) often makes the tester
more effective at finding defects and failures. Independence is not, however, a
replacement for familiarity, and developers can efficiently find many defects in their own
code. Which of the following is the lowest level of independence? [K1]

○ Tests designed by the person(s) who wrote the software under test with the low
level of independence

○ Tests designed by a person(s) from an outsourcing or certification by an external
body

○ Tests designed by a person(s) from an independent test team or performance test
specialists.

○ Tests designed by another person(s) from development team

-> Đáp án: A

05. The followings describe about causes of software defects. Which of the following is a
correct statement? [K1]

○ A developer makes a mistake which causes a bug that may be seen as a defect
when the software is executed.

○ A developer makes an error which results in a failure that may be seen as a fault
when the software is executed

○ A developer makes a mistake which causes a defect that may be seen as a failure
during dynamic testing

○ A developer has a failure which results in a defect that may be seen as a mistake
during dynamic testing

-> Đáp án: C

06. Which of the following statements is NOT true? [K2]

○ Rigorous testing is sometimes used to prove that all failures have been found.

○ Rigorous testing and fixing of found defects could help reduce the risk of problems
occurring in an operational environment.

○ Software testing is mainly needed to improve the quality of the product

○ Software testing may be required to meet legal or contractual requirements.

-> Đáp án: A

07. Which of the following statements correctly describes the difference between testing
and debugging? [K2]

○ Testing identifies the source of defects; debugging analyzes the faults and propose
prevention activities.

○ Dynamic testing shows failures caused by defects; debugging finds, analyzes, and
removes the causes of failures in the software

○ Testing removes faults; debugging identifies the causes of failures

○ Dynamic testing prevents the causes of failures, debugging removes the failures

-> Đáp án: B

08. A common perception of testing is that it only consists of running tests, i.e.., executing
the software. This is part of testing, but not all of the testing activities. Which of the
following statements is NOT one of testing objectives? [K1]

○ Providing information for decision-making

○ Finding defects

○ Gaining confidence about eh level of quality

○ Preventing errors

-> Đáp án: D

09. Non-functional testing includes, but is not limited to, performance testing, load testing,
stress testing, usability testing, maintainability testing, reliability testing and portability
testing. It is the testing of “how’ the system works. Where the Non-functional testing is
performed? [K1]

○ At system and acceptance testing levels only

○ At the acceptance testing level only

○ At all level above integration testing

○ At all test levels

-> Đáp án: D

10. What is the purpose of performing regression testing when system maintenance
activities have occurred? [K2]

○ To ensure no unauthorized changes have been applied to the system

○ Ensure the overall system has not regressed

○ To identify any maintainability issues with the code

○ To assess the scope of maintenance performed on the system

-> Đáp án: B
