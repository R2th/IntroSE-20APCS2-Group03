### How Augmented Reality Apps Work?
The AR industry is predicted to hit global revenues worth $90 billion by 2020. It is certain that this technology will evolve in the future. There are several ways in which this technology can be implemented in different industries. Tech companies are focusing on creating AR kits to make the development of apps easier and faster.

**1. Marker-based Apps**
Such apps work on the basis of image recognition feature. This technology uses the camera in AR device to produce results. A marker can be anything that has unique visual points. Digital images can be identified to decode the marker. The position and orientation of the object can be calculated. When pattern is identified, it is overlaid with an AR object. Marker-based apps capture the images of the physical world using camera and convert them into a grayscale image. The app can retrieve information stored to produce the 3D virtual object accurately. 

**2. Location-based Apps**
Location-based AR apps, also known as markerless, focus on position and geo-based augmented reality. It relies on digital compass, GPS, accelerometer, and more to identify the exact position of an object. Location-based augmented reality gives app developers a chance to engage the audience and make the experience interesting and exciting for them. You can trigger notifications based on location and deliver unique experience.
