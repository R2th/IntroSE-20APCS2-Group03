Dropshipping has become a common trend these days as sellers do not prefer to stock up the products. When a store sells the product, the items are directly shipped to the customer from a third party. In such scenarios, the merchant never sees or handles the product. One of the major advantages of this model is that it does not require a huge investment. There’s no need to worry about managing a huge inventory or the warehouse. Businesses that wish to start small can think of dropshipping and scale up the business later on.
