An age-old battle between native and cross-platform apps is still on. Though the cross-platform app development technology has an upper hand from the perspectives of cost and development duration, native apps are still a choice of many enterprises for offering a pleasant, native experience.

Let’s dig deep in the [cross-platform app development](https://www.solutionanalysts.com/phonegap-app-development/), which has several powerful weapons in its arsenal. One of them is React Native, which is designed and nurtured by a software giant Facebook.

Isn’t it interesting to compare both React Native and Native mobile app development because they exert a major impact on the app development process? But, before that let’s go through the basic information about both native and React Native app development:

What is Native Mobile App Development?
As the name suggests, a native mobile app provides native look and feel of a particular OS. These apps are written in the particular programming language for a specific platform. For example, an iOS app is written in either Swift or Objective-C (The official programming languages for iOS apps). Similarly, an Android app is written in either Kotlin or Java.

What is React Native Mobile App Development?
The growing demand for cross-platform apps leads to the rise of a JavaScript-based framework, React Native. This platform can build natively rendering mobile apps for both Android and iOS. An app development company can use this platform to make cross-platform apps with a native-like experience in a short duration.
