But today I would like to explain to you the importance of ServiceNow in the IT industry?  By the end the and of the article, you will be getting what makes so special to use ServiceNow in the IT industry.
Before going to explain the importance of ServiceNow in the IT industry let me introduce
**What is ServiceNow?**
ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides software management as a service. The ServiceNow specializes in IT service management, IT operations management and IT business management services.
It was built as a cross-departmental platform on the top of several applications. In today's cloud space, its ability to create the workflows can automate the process of data creation makes it more unique. usually, ServiceNow task, process, and activities occur on the cloud services and can be seen as a part of the comprehensive workflow that supports real-time communication, collaboration, and resource sharing.
 
 ServiceNow has service management offering for IT, human resource, security, customer service, Software development, marketing, finance, and legal enterprise needs.
This ServiceNow can fit in different premises. So now let me take you to the different service offer by the ServiceNow today
What is the importance of ServiceNow in the IT industry ?

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):**


Iaas is a form of cloud computing that provides the virtualized computing resources over the internet. in this model, the cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components, traditionally present on the on-premises data center. This includes the servers, storage networking hardware as well as the virtualization. usually, Iaas is responsible for managing everything from the operating system up to the running application.

**Platform as a Service(PaaS): **

Today for the successful completion of the project, we do need to several platforms. Developers did this to satisfy the client requirements. So initially the companies do not have many funds to buy all the platforms need to complete the project successfully. So starters do take this platform on rental base to temporarily satisfy the customer needs. Usually, PaaS is suitable to all the application needs. Additionally, it does require the OS maintenance, versions and patches.

**Software as a Service (SaaS):**

As said you above today project completion is dependent of multiple forms. And these platforms have different software. Today a software can be accessed in two ways namely the traditional and the alternative way. In general Software as a service refers to the alternative way of accessing a software.[ Service Now Online Training](https://onlineitguru.com/servicenow-online-training.html) refer this as a subscription model. Using the Saas model, the software is hosted on the internet and is accessed via the internet. In other words, it is a distributed software model that. A third party provider hosts these applications.
And one more feature to adopt ServiceNow by many developers is due to its architecture. Now let me move to its architecture:

**Architecture: **

Today most of the cloud computing architectures were the multi-tenant. For example, AWS, Azure, Salesforce, Oracle etc. The multi-tenant architectures create a single instance. Here.a single instance serves multiple customers. This usually deals with complex databases. This demand frequent maintenance, and often lead to unavailability of resources to the customers.
Multi-instance architecture: 
A unique instance is created for each employee. This maintains a separate resource stack. This gives freedom to the user-specific needs and enables to deal on the customer -customer needs. Now let me explain the article with an example.
Let us consider the architecture by an example.
In an isolated pool of resources consider three customers having a unique instance. It means that the hardware is being shared and the software like application, middleware and database are maintained separately. Here data isolation is an added advantage. 
Now  I would like to move to its applications

**ServiceNow applications : **

**IT Service Desk:**
According to the survey, on non - work related tasks people previously 15 out of 45 hours in a week . And the survey concluded the people uses the outdated ITSM. But in ServiceNow employees were provided with a self-service portal. Here, by messaging the concerned department staff, employees can avail all the IT services. Additionally, this could able to bring the ease of use of social media apps to ITSM sector. But this was lagging behind the legacy system.

**HR service delivery : **

Instead of concentrating the strategic task, HR does the repetitive task like employee onboarding. But ServiceNow would like to do all those with manual processing. And the task span across different departments like IT, Finance, Legal, Facilities. With  [ServiceNow Online course](https://onlineitguru.com/servicenow-online-training.html), I came to know that, a single ServiceNow platform can be used to connect the HR workflows with all these departments.
Likewise, there are many applications of ServiceNow. So it's a best thing to have a knowledge on these to sustain in the IT industry.
