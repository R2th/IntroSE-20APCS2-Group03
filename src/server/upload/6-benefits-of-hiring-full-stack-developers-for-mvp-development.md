As far as the language is anxious, full stack developer possess a strong knowledge of JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. The bootstrap will help in designing the data and layout. Regarding the JavaScript, it is better to be familiar with, Angular, React and Vue.js.

The Backend or the Business Logic

This is identified as the server-side layer of the application.The backend development languages are used to develop the logic for the website or app. Here too, you should have the strength in two or more server-side frameworks or languages such as Java with Spring MVC, Node.js with Express.js, Ruby with Ruby on Rails or Python with Django, etc. If you are selecting the static language, you need to write more codes but it would be at ease to maintain.

The Database

The database is also one of the important aspects of the backend development. In this step, you have to precisely develop and maintain the databases and therefore, this is where your expertise of database languages would play a significant role.

You can categorize the database languages into two types; Relational and Non-relational. The former is based on tables for the data storage while the other stores the data in the JSON layout.

How to Identify a Right Full Stack Developer?
HTTP & REST

HTTP generally creates protocols to create a secure communication network between the client and the server.So, if your product is a web application, then your appointed full stack developer must have the experience about the working process of HTTP as well as REST commands to make sure seamless configuration.

Data structures & algorithms

Algorithms play a significant portion of the development process, which is why your appointed full stack developer must identify all steps of using algorithms and should also be experienced with stacks, procedure, and heaps that goes across the process.

Doing so not only will help you have the correct code, but Google has also started questioning on data structures and algorithms.

Therefore, your code should consist of suitable algorithms and data structures so that it is easy to decide which code performs which exact task at any given time.

Deployment options

There are numbers of PaaS (Platform as a Service) deployment techniques available in the market nowadays. These options basically include Digital Ocean, AWS, Heroku, and more.

Heroku, on the one hand, provides the feature to upload the whole project code and deploy it with least configuration, while AWS, on the other hand, offers a handful of options for code deployment, data storage, and processing.

Though to use these platforms to your benefits, your appointed full stack developer should be aware of deployment as well as the configuration process of every platform.

Git

Git is a tool that provides developers as well as other project stakeholders to see the changes done in the code by individual developers.

This means, at any given moment, you can revise modifications in codes and when something goes wrong, you can almost instantly repeal the last working code to evade wasting a good amount of time recognizing and fixing a code error.

However, a full stack developer must have experience in using Git so that you are able to keep track of all defects and issues that are rising with new modifications.
