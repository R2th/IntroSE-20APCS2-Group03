The intensifying trend of mobility solutions agreement can be seen most significantly in the healthcare industry. Implementing these solutions have resulted in better patient care and experience. Blending IoT and AI in this industry will be a game changer. 

No doubt, the outlook of the health care industry will rely on the mobility solution you design. Many healthcare technologies like wearables, Internet of Medical things(IoMT), etc had been developed to improve the patient's care.

A study in 2018 shows that 72% of people felt that mobile apps perk up the patient's well-being, providing clinically actionable intelligence at the patient's bedside.
It is also expected that 97% of hospital nurses and 98% of doctors will use mobility solutions by 2022.

Mobile is reforming the patient care and driving efficiencies across the areas of healthcare. Focus on enhancing patients outcome by creating a successful clinical mobility approach. With the switch toward patient-centric care models, top hospitals are investing in mobile communication solutions to improve care quality, shrink healthcare delivery costs, and amplify patient satisfaction. 

No surprise that healthcare executives progressively contemplate mobile devices to be a fundamental part of the clinical strategy for boosting communication, efficiency, and productivity.
Are you wondering how the integration of [mobility solution](https://www.bigziel.com/mobile-application-development.php) makes the patient care in the hospital better? Don’t worry let me precise you how.

## WHY MOBILITY HEALTH SOLUTIONS IN HOSPITALS?

**PAPERLESS MEDICAL RECORDS:**

Gone are the days of using paper charts, waiting for the transcription details, decrypting scribbled notes. The transformation to the electronic medical records (EMR) is vital in bringing forward into the challenging healthcare environment. The EMR is stored in the central healthcare system which is accessible to the health care physicians from the mobile.  Obtain software support for strategic planning, workflow model, work resources training and customer support. 

* The EMR helps to enhance the communication between the patient and the health care professional thereby increasing data tracking and patient satisfaction.
* Medical errors can be eliminated by securing the patient's record which is not applicable in the traditional way of maintaining the health care records.
* Patient scheduling, report generation, e-prescribing can be prepared by the physicians to the patients to make the process easy.

From the research of BMJ Quality & Safety study, EMR has reduced the death rates by 15%.

**SIMPLE CONSULTING AND COMMUNICATION:**

Fixing an appointment for consulting the health care professional was a tedious task. It is a marathon where you need to stand in a very long queue to fix an appointment. With the advent of mobility solutions, the consultation process is made much simpler using mobile phones.
There is a number of places in the hospital within where the communication plays a vital role. For instance, health care professionals can send the medicine details of a patient via EMR to their pharmacy. This process is made smooth by health care mobility solutions.

The emergency situation can be met by the nurses themselves by contacting the health care professional to take the right decision. 

There has been a revolution in mobile apps that provides healthcare solutions to the patients online through the video call. This works as a whole like a hospital in mobile. 

**KNOW THE PATIENTS THROUGH MOBILITY SOLUTION**:

As a health care provider, your first objective should be the patients care. It should not be compromised at any cost. The patient's medical history, his previously prescribed medicines, current diagnosis, lab reports can be viewed from anywhere through the health care mobility solution app. The mobility solutions facilitate in

* ease the overburdened health care staffs
* Timely patient care
* Operation schedule
* Organization
* Inpatient and outpatient management
 
There are a number of apps which enables the calculation of blood pressure, heart rate, glucose level within no time. 

**OPTIMIZES NURSING ACTIVITIES:**

To know about their shifts, provide the patients the medicine on time, update with the task the health care mobility solution app plays a major role. The app helps is assisting the nurses to attend the patient and provide the utmost care.

There is an app called NurseAlert which is a bomb to keep the nurses up-to-date like shift management, attending patients on time, providing medicines with the help of the reminders in the app.

Since the patient's data are stored online, there are security threats posed on that information of the patients in health care mobility solutions.

## SECURITY CHALLENGES TO HEALTH CARE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS:

The health care mobility solutions leverage technologies like cloud, web applications, mobile applications to create an organizational infrastructure. This mobility solution helps the employees to access all the healthcare information of the patients and their personal information from the smartphone, laptops, PDAs, tablets, etc.

Dimension Data's recent survey proves that mobility solutions bring 90% of productivity. 44% of the people stated that they were not able to access all the information from the centralized system since there are security concerns.
92% of the enterprises have limitations for the employees for accessing sensitive resources and data from their mobile phones.

Let us see the solutions for security threats to the enterprise.

**ACCESS CONTROL**

It's becoming difficult for organizations to keep track of the patients and employees who accesses the hospital's network. So, to stay away from security breaches that evolve from unauthorized users, the healthcare centers allow only a few personnel to access sensitive information.

Stringent Identity Authentication can be made to overcome security threats. 2-factor authentication is used for cloud-based mobility solutions.

**ENCRYPTION**

It plays a vital game in data protection. It can protect the data even when the device is stolen with no password in it. To make this viable, there is a need for a protected workplace where all the data are protected. As soon as any activity is viewed outside the secured workplace, the protected apps get locked automatically.

**FOLLOW  RESTRICTION POLICY:**

Educate the employees about the risk of using the third party app. Training must be provided regularly for enforcing the mobile restriction policy.

**SOFTWARE UPDATION**

I hope you are no strange to a pop us that arrives making aware of the software updates. It actually tempts you to press Remind me later button. For god's sake, don’t click it, instead update your software for the following reason.

* Repairs security holes 
* Fixes bugs
* Facilitates to patch security flaws
* It's not only you (if your device occupies virus, you may pass it to your friends, family and, colleagues too).

**ENFORCE SOFTWARE CERTIFICATE RESTRICTION POLICY:**

Software restriction policy facilitates the users and the devices from executing unauthorized code such as trojan, viruses, etc. This certificate rule must be enabled in the setting of software restriction policy.

**ENABLE GEOFENCING IN THE DEVICE**

Geofencing enables an extra layer of security to the mobile devices who are trying to control the enterprise-owned and employee-owned devices. 

The Geofencing technology can locate the lost device with the help of GPS and a local beacon. 
It is an essential perimeter around a geographic area that can supply an additional layer of access control to business resources, not only servers.  For instance, the functionality and access rights assigned to mobile applications can be changed automatically based on the location of the device relative to geofence boundaries.

With geofencing technology, you can ensure devices do not leave definite areas, like an office environment.
