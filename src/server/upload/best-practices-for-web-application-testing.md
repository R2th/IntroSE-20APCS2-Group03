Testing, as the final stage of the development of the website, plays a vital role in the process of creating high-quality software. After the website testing, the customer is provided with a ready project without errors, with good readability, perceived ease, convenience, and reliability.

The basic rules for testing of a website are steps that show the user how easy and logical the project is, how easy and possible to find the required information.
The more complex the site, the more time it takes to test it and debug it. Depending on the specifics of the project, up to 50% of the total budget and time resources can be allocated to test a website.

To organize the testing of the website, a specially developed methodology is provided. The verification of your website is carried out according to this methodology.
Testing can occur in a variety of ways, but do not forget about the process itself and the testing strategy. The sequence of your actions depends on it.

So, let's consider the main stages you have to pass to test your site:


## Documentation Testing
The main artifacts related to the website testing are analyzed on this stage:
* Requirements
* Test Plan
* Test Cases
* Traceability Matrix

We should start with the preparatory phase, testing the documentation.

## Website Functionality Testing
Functional testing is aimed to ensure that each function of the website operates in conformance with the requirement specification.  Website testing of the functionality shows **“*What the system does?*”**

Let's try to create the checklist for you website functionality testing.

### *Links Testing:*
You should verify:

### *HTML/CSS Validation:*

* HTML syntax errors

## Usability Testing
Usability testing is aimed to evaluate your web page by testing it with representative users. It helps to define user ability to learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of your site.

### *Navigation Testing contains the next verifications:*

* Testing the graphical user interface on target devices: smartphones and tablets.


## Compatibility (Configuration) testing
**Compatibility (Configuration) Testing** is performed to test your website with each one of the supported software and hardware configurations:

* OS Configuration
* Browser Configuration
* Database Configuration

***Cross-Platform Testing*** allows evaluating the work of your site in different OS (both desktop and mobile): Windows, iOS/Mac OS, Linux, Android and BlackBerry etc.

## Performance Testing
Performance testing is aimed to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a certain load. Sites must withstand high loads. 

***Perfomance website testing methods contain:***

* Testing site behavior at increasing workload **(Load Testing)**
* Testing the ability to work within or just above the acceptable period **(Stability Testing)**
* Testing of website performance by increasing the data volume  in the database **(Volume Testing)**
* Testing of website performance when multiple users login to it **(Concurrency Testing)**
* Testing the behavior of your site when the additional workload is given continuously **(Endurance Testing)**
* Page load speed testing


## Security Testing
Security testing is performed to verify the information system protects data and maintains functionality as intended.

You can simulate the malicious source attack to evaluate the security level of your site (Penetration testing).

Another kind of security testing, Vulnerability testing, allows evaluating the total quantum of involved risks.

***Some verifications for the security testing:***

* Ensure the unauthorized access to secure pages is not possible
* Verify sessions are automatically killed after prolonged user inactivity
* Test SSL security functions
* All attempts at breaking, reporting errors etc. should be logged and stored in a separate file for further analysis.
* Check the captcha work using automatic scripts
* Ensure restricted files are not downloadable without appropriate access
* Ensure there is no login ability while entering wrong password or username


## Change Related Testing
***Change related testing*** has two main purposes:

* Ensuring all detected bugs have indeed been successfully fixed **(Re-Testing or Confirmation Testing)**. In a few words, you should run the test cases that originally detected the bugs again and this time they pass without any problems.

***Beta Testing*** – the final prerelease stage of testing. As a rule, it is done by end-users and out stuff people.

Beta testing replaces your site in the hands of real users outside of your team to discover any weak points from the user’s perspective that you would not want to have in your final, released version of the application
