### What is Spree commerce?
Spree is most popular Platform on Ruby that is a easy to use and elegantly designed software. It ensures greater flexibility in managing your store and is a visual treat. It includes a wide variety of features including mail marketing and CRM tools.

Spree has become one of the most popular open-source eCommerce platforms built with Ruby on Rails. It is aimed at building large online stores and a wide variety of features. Spree is known for being lightweight when compared to platforms like Magento or Shopify due to its minimal approach to code design.

Any way Spree is also a fully-featured e-commerce solution that can be easily integrated into a Rails application. If you need to turn a Rails app into a store that sells products then Spree is one of the quickest ways to do this. In this episode weâ€™ll set up Spree in a new Rails application and customize some of its functionality so that you can get an idea as to how it works and see if it fits the needs of your application.

Spree consists of several different gems (modules) which allows full customization (e.g. Spree can be used in API-only mode to create a custom storefront or use spree_frontend module that will give you a default customizable Spree storefront).
