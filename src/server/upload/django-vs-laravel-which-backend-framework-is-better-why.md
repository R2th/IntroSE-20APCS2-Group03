<p>Okay, so over the last couple of weeks, we’ve been getting a lot of emails and messages on selecting an ideal web development framework. A lot of tech-driven entrepreneurs asked us which framework should they go for – Django or Laravel.</p>
<p>Well, we thought why not explain everything we know about this on a post.</p>
<p>Though a little technical, we’ll try to keep it as light and lucid as possible.</p>
<p>To understand which web development framework is better, we need to get our foundation strong. Understanding what frameworks are and the types of it will give us a systematic understanding of what framework does what and which is better.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with the basics.</p>
<h2>What are Web Development Frameworks?</h2>
<p>Like you know, web development is a complex process. However, to make this comparatively easier, there are diverse sets of resources available. These set of resources are called frameworks. If you’re wondering what these frameworks include, they comprise of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Templates to present information to users in a browser</li>
<li>An ideal programming environment</li>
<li>APIs or Application Programming Interface</li>
<li>And services and essentials to build content management systems</li>
</ol>
<p>Development frameworks are of two types – <strong>Frontend Frameworks</strong> and <strong>Backend Frameworks</strong></p>
<h4>1. Frontend Frameworks</h4>
<p>By definition, frontend refers to web aspects that are visible to users. Frontend frameworks are packages that contain pre-written codes categorized in different folders. Frontend frameworks act as the foundation for you to build your final product with seamless flexibility.</p>
<p>A typical frontend framework contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grids that allow you to organize design elements</li>
<li>Predefined font styles and sizes</li>
<li>Website components that are prebuilt such as buttons, navigation bars, side panels and more</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. Backend Frameworks</h4>
<p>Also called server-side programming, backend is everything that happens under-the-hood. Backend frameworks take care of implementing server-side logics such as storing data, retrieving data, dealing with and processing data, managing responses and more.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic idea of what frameworks are, let’s dive in a little deeper to understand what Django and Laravel are and about their advantages and disadvantages and ultimately, which is better.</p>

<h2>Django Framework</h2>
<p>An open-source framework, Django is written in Python and is used to develop complex websites and web applications.</p>
<p>It follows a Model-View-Template architectural pattern and is popular because of its lightweight features and standalone modules for testing and development.</p>
<p>Launched in the year 2005 by Django Software Foundation, this framework is deployed by some popular companies like Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest and more.The entire purpose of Django is to simplify the process of development of complex websites and apps and save time. Because of this, Django arrives as an ideal tool for startups.</p>

<h4>Advantages of Django Framework</h4>
<h4>1. Speed</h4>
<p>One of the primary advantages of Django is that it allows developers to build apps and websites as swiftly as possible. If launching a portal within a tight deadline is your concern, Django should help you do it.</p>
<h4>2. Security</h4>
<p>Django allows little to no space for developers to make mistakes on security breaches or compromises. The framework helps developers to avoid making common mistakes like SQL injection, clickjacking, cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting and more.</p>
<h4>3. Scalability</h4>
<p>Django is perfect for websites or apps that are prone to heavy traffic. Thanks to its scalability feature, managing upsurges in traffic is not a big deal at all.</p>
<h4>Cons of Django Framework</h4>
<ol>
<li>Django can be a little problematic for the development of smaller websites or applications</li>
<li>Routing in Django is quite difficult</li>
<li>Django offers no notifications or alerts when there are errors in templates</li>
</ol>
<h2>Laravel Framework</h2>
<p>Created by Tayler Otwell, Laravel was initially rolled out in the year 2011. In a span of a decade, Laravel has grown to become one of the most popular web development frameworks among development communities.</p>
<p>It follows a Model-View-Control architecture and is ideal to build content management systems.</p>
<p>Besides, its built-in features are designed to make the job of a web developer easier and it also simplifies the complex task of developing an application from scratch.</p>

<p>Laravel is used by 9GAG, Toyota Hall Of Fame, UNION and more.</p>
<h4>Pros of Laravel Framework</h4>
<h4>1. Minimum Learning Curve</h4>
<p>What makes Laravel stand out is the fact that it is very easy to learn. It has a solid developer community and its documentation is very simple for beginners to comprehend and get started. This means you can easily <a title="hire certified Laravel developer" href="https://www.techtic.com/laravel-development-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hire certified Laravel developer</a>.</p>
<h4>2. Artisan</h4>
<p>Laravel allows you to seamlessly develop command-line applications thanks to its amazing Artisan CLI. It comprises of several advanced tools that allow you to easily perform tasks and migrations.</p>
<h4>3. Latest PHP Features</h4>
<p>One of the best advantages of Laravel is that it is up-to-date with all the latest features of PHP. While other frameworks are yet to catch up, you get access to some latest features in Interfaces, Namespaces, Anonymous functions, Overloading and more with Laravel 5.</p>
<h4>Cons of Laravel Framework</h4>
<ol>
<li>Laravel lacks the payments feature.</li>
<li>The upgrade from Laravel 5 to 4 is not seamless. Meaning, updating your code could break your application.</li>
<li>It always doesn’t offer 100% mobile richness.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Which is Better? Django Vs Laravel</h2>

<p>No development framework is perfect. The impact each framework leaves depends on the type of project it is deployed for.</p>
<p>So, if you’re using Django to develop something lightweight, you would not experience the framework’s full potential. It all boils down to choosing the right framework for the right project.</p>
<p>However, if you still intend to know which framework has an edge over the other, this would help.</p>
<h2>The Edge in Features: Django Vs Laravel</h2>
<p>When it comes to the features that each framework brings to the table, Laravel definitely has an advantage.</p>
<p>For instance, routing can be a little problematic in Django as there is no builtin structure to develop an API. You either develop one by yourself or use the REST framework.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Laravel makes routing simple because you have an easy way to develop API. Thanks to the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) and high-level abstraction on relational databases, developers can write codes in Python (and not on SQL) to read, create, modify, or erase schemas and data in a database.</p>
<p>Not just that, a Laravel website is comparatively faster and offers in-house support. It supports SASL, cache backends and more features.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Like we mentioned, each frameworks has its own set of pros and cons. But comparatively, Laravel is ideal for the development of both simple and complex websites and apps.</p>

<p>Besides, it also allows you to spend little time on in-house training instead of requiring you to hire Laravel developer.</p>
