### VIM Editor Commands

Vim is an editor to create or edit a text file.   

There are two modes in vim. One is the **`command mode`** and another is the**`insert mode`**.  

In the **command mode**, user can move around the file, delete text, etc.  

In the **insert mode**, user can insert text.  

### Changing mode from one to another
