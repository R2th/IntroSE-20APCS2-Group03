Security Testing is the process to identify vulnerabilities, threats in the software applications and ensure that due to any of the security issues application flow does not stop working. Software security testing help to software developers to overcome the future risks in software applications and fixing them by the coding itself.
To understand potential vulnerabilities and secure the data and resources, Security testing cover the following attributes such as;

* Authentication
* Confidentiality
* Non-repudiation
* Authorization
* Authorization
* Integrity

Top Types of Security Testing:
There are various types of Security Testing services which are apply by the top [Software Testing Company](https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/) to perform software security testing such as;
* Vulnerability Scanning
* Security Scanning
* Penetration Testing
* Risk Assessment
* Security Auditing

Let’s explore this one by one;

Vulnerability Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning is the automation software used to identify security vulnerabilities of the product. 

Security Scanning: This is done through Manual or Automation. The simple meaning of Security Scanning is that scanning the security of application, computer program and identify the system or application weakness and offer suitable solution to overcome the future risk. 

Penetration Testing: We can also called it as a Pen Testing. This type of Pen testing help us to overcome the cyber-attacks form malicious. This testing done through the analysis of outside hacking attempt and verify the system is secure from the potential vulnerabilities.

Risk Assessment: As per the number of loss and number of the vulnerability occurrence such as high/ low, This type of software security testing divide the security risk of the organizations and try to reduce such risk as per the future point of view.

Security Auditing: To verify the security flow, this security testing type perform the audit by the internal inspection

Tools of Security Testing:

In Software Security Testing, There are different kinds of tools are used to deliver quality result, and such tools are listed as follows;
* Owasp
* WireShark
* W3af
* Skipfish
* Grabber
* Zed Attack Proxy
* Vega
* Ratproxy

Conclusion:
Software security testing is most important and focused part of application security. To overcome the security related bugs, errors and to protect data from hackers software tester’s play’s an important role in this process.
