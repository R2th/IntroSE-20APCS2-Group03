Initial coin offerings or its more popular acronym, ICO, has taken the world of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and investments by storm. It presents a dependable channel of fundraising, especially for crypto projects. For technology enthusiasts and people who did not find ways to directly buy stocks using IPOs, ICOs are a welcome bliss.

Developing an ICO is a tedious and cumbersome process. Thankfully, for this purpose, there are a lot of dedicated ICO development companies that can take care of the dirty job. However, the real challenge in making your ICO a holistic success lies in effective marketing.

Marketing and ICO is a combination of both traditional and modern methods. It should be a melange of marketing activities common to any digital endeavor and some of them specific to crypto projects.

# A bit about ICOs

Although the first ICO might have happened in 2013, it is the Ethereum ICO that brought it to prominence. It had to wait for another three years before it became a phenomenon. In 2017, ICOs accounted for about $5.6 billion raised. Although they might seem lucrative from the surface, the fact that ICOs are not regulated gave rise to a lot of scams, ultimately marring the image, not just of ICOs but crypto and blockchain at large.

Therefore, your marketing efforts should be bent not only on increasing the possibility of your tokens being sold but also in building credibility.

The whitepaper serves as an exhaustive material for your investors to go through. Generally, not even 10% of your investors might go through the whitepaper. However, those 10% of people are quite sure to be convinced investors.

In addition, the website should also display information about the tentative timeline, the roadmap of your project, and also the details of your team members.
