Rocketbook is best-known for creating a $30 smart notebook which wipes clean with a damp cloth. If you’re looking for a smart notebook that sends handwritten notes to your devices, Rocketbook is my personal recommendation based on its price, reliability, and simplicity. Keep on reading Rocketbook Review to see if it’s really worth buying.

**How it works

You can write in the notebook with the included FriXion pen, take a picture to scan notes, and seamlessly send a PDF or JPEG of your writing to to a host of destinations (email, messages, iCloud, Google Docs , Dropbox and more). Then, when you’re done and want a new page, grab a wet cloth and wipe it down. Your notes are off, and you can start the process again.

**Why Rocketbook ?

When you buy Rocketbook  notebook, you can receive:
***No more wasting paper

You can use this notebook endlessly and forever. All you have to do is wipe the synthetic paper with the microfiber towel it comes with. You can use the pen it comes with as well as a pilot Frixion pen, marker, or highlighter.

***It comes in two different sizes***
It comes in two different sizes. The sizes are called Executive and Letter For someone who wants a normal size such as 8.5 inches by 11 inches should get the executive size and if someone wants a journal size such as 6 inches by 8.8 inches they should get the letter size.

***Pages are scannable and transferrable***
You can scan the pages in which it becomes a document that you can upload in different folders. Also, there is an app you can download on the apple store or the android store to scan the pages and have them on the app as well.

**The Rocketbook Writing Experience**

Overall, Rocketbook provides a pretty good writing experience. It is much better than writing on an iPad with Apple Pencil or writing on just about any type of tablet using a stylus. We rate it about 90% as good as writing on regular notebooks.

There are three main things that keep the writing experience from being as good as regular paper:
1. Frixion pens will not give you the same dark lines as high quality pens on regular paper. However, you can produce a line that’s almost as good with a bit of practice.
2. The glossy texture of the paper makes it possible to erase ink, which is great. But as a result, it lacks the same grip and precision you get when writing on regular paper.
3. Ink from Frixion pen takes about 10 seconds to dry. This is not a big issue, but there is a risk of ink smearing if you brush or hand the page before it dries.

We should also note that the Frixion pen does not last as long as a normal pen. How long they exist depends on how much you use them and what you are writing about. But a 3-pack Frixion pens is around $5, so replacing them isn’t a big deal.

**Rocketbook Price**

The final thing to consider when purchasing the Rocketbook is the price. We won’t deny it — the Rocketbook costs more than most notebooks on the market. So if you’re used to buying $2 notebooks from Walmart or Target, then you’re in for a bit of sticker shock.
Here’s how the pricing breaks down for the Rocketbook:
* Mini — $16
* Executive and Letter — $30 – $35 (depending on where you buy them)

While it’s more expensive than a basic notebook from the discount store, the Everlast is comparable in price to other premium notebooks such as the Moleskine. And considering that you can use the Rocketbook an essentially infinite number of times, we think it’s a worthwhile investment.
