The traditional taxi industry is suffering in the hands of the giants like Ola, Lyft, etc. The traditional firms used an age-old manual dispatch system. This system is outdated and the failure to innovate cost them huge. Also, the app-based companies raised millions of dollars from external funding for the operation which gave them more advantage. Firms like Uber and Lyft have expanded their operations to many countries globally.

Another reason for their success is their less ownership model. Literally, the on-demand firms swept the traditional taxi business. But that is not the end of them.

Now there is a renewed chance for the traditional companies to revive with new energy. It is because of the advanced taxi dispatch system. The present taxi dispatch system is a combination of taxi booking and latest technologies like IoT, AI, etc.

So, traditional taxi businesses who are not able to fit inside the on-demand model can overhaul their business by using the latest [taxi dispatch software](https://www.spotnrides.com/taxi-dispatch-software).

In the latest taxi dispatch system, everything is app based and there is no room for error. There will be a dispatcher panel in addition to what is there in an on-demand system. Once the customer books a cab, the dispatcher panel releases a cab after the admin approval. Apart from these operations, maintenance, inspection, fuel, mileage, etc can also be managed.
