Building an e-commerce website has become a cup of tea for all entrepreneurs. They will reach a skilled developer to [build a marketplace like Amazon, eBay](https://blog.zielcommerce.com/build-marketplace-website-like-amazon-ebay/), etc. Now the most difficult challenge that every developer faces is to choose the best platform to build the project, especially for front-end development. The front-end framework they select should give an amazing user experience.

## Choosing the Best Option for Front-End Development

The front-end framework that we select for our project should have better modularity, easy code reusability, and should enforce good design patterns. 

In recent days, the two main front-end frameworks that come with high-quality code are React and Angular. They both have their own pace in the ever-changing marketplace and are popular, robust, and have a high level of support. Let us analyze both the front-end framework with current statistics.

##### Current Statistics by Popularity

* While checking the popularity on GitHub, React holds 160K stars where Angular holds 68K stars.
* According to BuiltWith statistics, Reach powers 2 million websites, while Angular powers 97,000 websites.
* The number of Node Package manager downloads is 10% higher with React when compared to Angular.

#### Main Principles of Angular

Angular is a reliable open-source JavaScript Framework powered by Google. This front-end framework is compatible with numerous code editors. Google Adwords, which is Google’s one of the crucial projects, is built with Angular as its front-end framework. 

The core goal of Angular is to simplify the development process. When you plan to build a dynamic single-page app, Angular excels well compared to any other front-end framework.

The accessibility of Angular is not user-friendly for any programmer. Angular follows its own process that deals with its service controllers and also its modules. Getting along with its principles is quite challenging for developers.

**Few aspects highly influence the accessibility of Angular and are listed below.**

* Developers should have enough knowledge about Object-oriented programming (OOP) as Angular uses OOP.
* Also, developers should have clear working experience with TypeScript.
* In addition to the above, developers should also know RxJs.

Apart from all inconveniences and complexity that angular has, there are many more benefits that make it to be popular and reliable to build the application.

* Automated synchronization with two-way binding is possible with Angular where other frameworks provide one-way binding. Data between Model and view are perfectly synchronized in real-time. Manual modifications are not needed and this reduces the workload of the developer.
* Server communication is genuinely optimized by angular and so the response time to API calls is quick and very productive.
* The code structure of Angular is handy and very independent as it uses the Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) model.
* The dependency injection (DI) of angular will manage all major scopes and controllers, thus making the testing process an easier one.
* Angular comes with a perfect comprehensive UI that has the best navigation elements, layouts, buttons, and data tables.

#### Who Chooses Angular Today?

For developing applications mainly for enterprises and corporate sectors, developers will definitely prefer Angular as the trustable front-end framework. This is mainly because of its code consistency and robust ecosystem.

Angular has an active community where you can get all-time support from experts available in the community. It is also easy to handle heavy web applications with Angular.

If you plan to develop a video streaming app like Youtube or an e-commerce application like T-Mobile, or a real-time data application like weather.com, or a user-generated content portal like Upwork, you have no other choice than Angular as it has a high level of code flexibility.

### What makes React.js Different?

There is no doubt that React is taking over the front-end development in recent days. React.js has its own importance and individuality that make the platform stand-alone in the application development industry. Let us get into detail regarding react.js uniqueness.

* Developers will gain the ability to work with virtual browsers while using React.js. It simplifies the working process of developers mainly with DOM API.
* React is a simple API with few functions. So it is very easy for developers to study, react and develop applications using it.
* The components of react.js are reusable and composable which facilitates any developer to easily handle the code.
* React maintains a virtual representation of HTML in memory, thus React uses Virtual DOM to handle HTML trees.
* React is unique mainly because it allows its components to break down the complex UI and make it more user-friendly.
* React.js becomes exceptional when it comes to speed. It has a perfect run-time performance compared with other front-end frameworks.
* React.js helps to improve the total rendered pages from the server-side and it is designed accordingly.   
* Using react.js can improve your SEO for web apps as it renders pages from server to browser easily.
* React.js improves the debugging speed and completes the testing process at the earliest and increases the developer’s productivity.

#### React.js Innovations in Performance

* React.js maintains a document object module (DOM) in its memory and it is termed as Virtual DOM.
* Whenever there is a change made in the UI component, React.js will note the change in its Virtual DOM first.
* React.js periodically updates the browser’s DOM while checking with its virtual DOM and checks the version compatibility.
* The DOM gets updated by react.js on all essential changes that happen within the development of the app.

The computing algorithms of react.js handle the complete operation and decide on when to do the updation in DOM and makes react.js to be performative compared to other front-end frameworks.
