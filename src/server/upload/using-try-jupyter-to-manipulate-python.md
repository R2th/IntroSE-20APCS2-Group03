Recently I am learning Python personally so I would like to write about it.

I'll explain Try Jupyter, which I use to execute Python.

First, click the following URL to access Try Jupyter.

https://jupyter.org/try

Then the following page is displayed go to "Try Classic Notebook".

If you write Python code in the cell in this screen, you can execute the code.

First of all, let's put in the following code for basical understanding.

Enter the above code into the cell below,

You can run the code by clicking "Run" at the top of the page.

Here's how to run Python from Try Jupyter.

It is recommended because it can be used immediately on the Web without the need to get used to a development environment.

However, be aware that the connection with the Web server will be lost if a certain period of time elapses without any operation.
