DevOps is the most rapidly growing topic of interest for readers. So, we figured why not give you guys more info on how DevOps can help you win the race for machine learning. DevOps tools are designed to provide the necessary processes to accomplish these goals by automating common activities such as configuration management, continuous integration, deployment automation, etc. There are many advantages to adopting DevOps principles in your machine learning pipeline

The tools and methods of DevOps are being used in more fields than ever before. From production to testing, and even development; many companies have embraced the DevOps culture for its flexibility and productivity. 

In this article, we will be talking about how some of these methods can help you win the race for AI with machine learning as a key component. 

Machine Learning is an important tool that is going to help us in so many ways in the future. However, it needs support from other systems. 

And this is what we will be focusing on in this article. Today we will learn about:

A) What is DevOps?
B) What is machine learning?
C) What are machine learning tools?

So, let's get going, shall we?

## A) What is DevOps

I get it, we have talked a lot about **[DevOps](https://www.hdatasystems.com/blog/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-devops)** in the past. Some of you will go, “We know, we know,” Like Captain America standing in front of his younger self in the Avengers Endgame. 

But here’s the thing, there are a lot of people who are new readers, and those who want to learn about DevOps.
So, our dear older readers, if you feel that we are repeating our words, then feel free to skip this part.

Now, with this being said and done, let us focus on DevOps itself.
DevOps is a term that describes the process of merging software development and IT operations. What makes DevOps so special? It's the idea that teams can work together to create systems, without barriers or boundaries. 

It doesn't matter if you're on one side of the spectrum, such as a developer who just wants to code, or if you're on the other end like an Operations person who has more hands-on skills with system management and deployment. 

There should be no separation between these departments

DevOps is a concept that has been around for quite some time, but the term "DevOps" was coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois. DevOps describes a culture of developers and IT operations personnel working together to provide more efficient, faster release cycles.

We will answer these questions in today's article. DevOps is a movement that encompasses two things: a philosophy and its corresponding practices. The philosophy includes attitudes towards collaboration, continuous learning, risk-taking, communication skills, and attention to detail. Practices include tools like Chef or Puppet for configuration management; GitHub for version control etc. 

This is the most basic that one must know if they want to expand further

With the introduction of DevOps done, let us focus on our second topic, which is, Machine Learning. 

**B) What is machine learning?**
Alright, other than DevOps, machine learning is probably our most asked topic. We have already written a plethora on Machine Learning. Just like DevOps, we will start with a basic introduction and you can feel free to skip this section if you are one of our old readers. 

[Machine learning](https://www.hdatasystems.com/machine-learning) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. In the past few years, machine learning has been the talk of the town with the advancement in technology and the availability of more data for training algorithms. 

This field is so important because it provides an excellent way to make decisions without human intervention when there are many variables involved. It can predict outcomes or patterns by analyzing historical data and finding hidden insights using mathematical models. The need for machine learning arises from its ability to find unknown patterns.

Machine learning is a technique in computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It provides systems with the capability of automatically detecting patterns and correlations in data, after which it can make predictions or decisions based on these findings. It was first introduced back in 1954 by Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer of artificial intelligence (AI). He created one of the first machine-learning algorithms called "The Checkers Player".

Alright, with all our pieces set, now it is time to get to the real deal. 

## C) What are machine learning tools?
1) Prometheus:
You’re in luck, dear readers. Prometheus is a free-to-use open-source monitoring system. You can get the whole buck here, from things like notifications of alerts to custom libraries. 

2) Snort:
Don’t let the funny logo and name affect you. Snort is one of the most powerful tools for targeting intruders. If you are looking for one of the best security software that can protect you against malicious attacks.

3) Nagios.
Yes, its name kind of reminds you of nachos. No, it’s not a food app. Nagios is one of the best tools to help you improve your infrastructure. 

## Conclusion
There are two different paths to take in the race for AI, machine learning, and other technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). One is a slow-paced journey with small improvements on what already exists, while the other path is one where developers will be able to create something new. The second path has a lot more risk but also more reward. It's time for companies to think about which route they want to take and start making decisions now so that they can make an impact in their field.
