## EC2
AWS EC2 is the oldest and most popular service on AWS. EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware upfront, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
+ Virtual computing environments, known as instances.
+ Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software).
+ Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, are known as instance types.
+ Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place).
+ Storage volumes for temporary data that are deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes.
+ Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes.
+ Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, are known as Regions and Availability Zones.
+ A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups.
+ Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, are known as Elastic IP addresses.
+ Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources.
+ Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs).

With AWS EC2 you can easy to run high-performance computing.

## High-Performance Computing
The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC because you can create a very high number of resources in no time.

AWS provides you various services to run large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads with virtually unlimited compute capacity, a high-performance file system, and high-throughput networking.

### AWS high-performance computing services

**EC2:** Support virtually any workload with the secure, resizable compute capacity of Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) and the latest-generation processors.

**Elastic Fabric Adapter:** Run HPC applications at scale with Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), a network for Amazon EC2 instances with high-level inter-node communications capabilities.

**AWS ParallelCluster:** Quickly build HPC compute environments with AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source tool that simplifies the deployment and management of HPC clusters.

**AWS Batch:** Scale hundreds of thousands of computing jobs across all AWS compute services and features with AWS Batch, a cloud-native batch scheduler.

**Amazon FSx for Lustre:** Quickly process massive datasets on-demand and at scale with Amazon FSx for Lustre, a high-performance file system with sub-millisecond latencies.

**NICE DCV:** Deliver a high-performance remote desktop and 3D application graphics with NICE DCV, a bandwidth-efficient, and high-performance streaming protocol.

### HPC Use cases
**Build designs faster**
