No matter how big or small a non-profit organization is the amount of social media engagement they receive is still divided. Some nonprofits got successful at getting the engagement they had wished for but some didn’t. We often hear from nonprofits that “Social media algorithms have killed our engagements this year” or “it’s hard to cut through the confusion and noise on Facebook”. Social Media Marketing for Nonprofit Organizations

Before you understand how you can get more social media engagement for your nonprofit organization you first need to understand the social media algorithms. To put it clearly you first need to know what are these algorithms, what they do and why do they even exist.

### What are social media algorithms: –
Social media algorithms are a way of sorting outposts in a user’s feed based on their relevance instead of published time. The biggest of social media platforms use these algorithms to prioritize which content a user sees in their newsfeed based on their likings and what they actually want to see. Social media posts are not chronological anymore and have not been for a long time. This is the main reason why you won’t be able to annoy your friends or followers as most of them won’t be able to even see the things you post.

### The reason why these algorithms exist: –
It is actually very simple why these algorithms exist. Social networks are business and all they want is for people to stay on their site and focus on user experience. For example, if you log on to Facebook, **[Instagram](https://www.writersevoke.com/new-instagram-update-2019-how-to-update-whats-changing-this-year/)**, etc. and don’t find posts that are of your interest then you won’t spend time on the site.

There are four strategies that nonprofit organizations must use to increase their social media engagement and to win this social media algorithm battle.

### Get out of your content comfort zone: –
The best way to be successful in digital marketing and social media is to have a plan of action in place to frequently post interesting, relevant, important content which is focused on the wants and interests of your users. You cannot post whatever you want to. You also cannot continue to use social media as a one-way advertising platform. Although ads have a place on these platforms but your content should be user-focused.

### You should post more videos: –
Videos are by far the most popular form of content which is being shared on social media and on all the other platforms. Videos on Facebook on average see more than 135% organic reach then simple images. The average Facebook user spends 3 times the time watching videos that are live rather than those which are not.

They also comment 10 times more during live videos. 80% of people said that they would rather tune into a live video than read a blog post. 82% of the people said that they were more interested in watching a live video from a brand than reading generic social media posts.

### Try experimenting with paid social media Ads: –
Even though there is a lot that you can do with free content available on social media, nonprofit organizations must start experimenting with paid Ads to get even more reach on social media and get the proper exposure for certain posts.
