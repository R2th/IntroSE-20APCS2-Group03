Mobile app development has been constantly moving toward creating complex and progressive apps in terms of design and functionalities. In order to meet users’ demand of being able to connect on the go and providing continuous, seamless access to data regardless of location makes the job of a Mobile App Development Company more challenging. The next generation of Internet connectivity, 5G networks offer reliable connection and unprecedented speed on mobile devices.

**Why is 5G Touted to be the Most Disruptive Technology of Modern Times?**
It is hard even to imagine that within the time taken for blinking your eyes, millions of data can be transferred from any system to millions of other devices anywhere in the world. It is just a few more months now for the onset of 5G wireless network to shape into reality and combine data computation efficiently with myriad devices in just a matter of seconds.

This powerful technology is about to transform mobility forever; it is not just a network; it is rather the underlying fabric that supports a total ecosystem created out of completely connected devices. It will overhaul economic policies and business 180 degrees across the globe. 5G mobile technology has been quoted as one of the top 10 technology trends about to go mainstream in 2019.

Impact of 5G on Mobile App Development
During the process of app development, it is common that a Mobile App Development Company has to take into consideration the device features and network requirements in order to assure that the mobile app works properly while fulfilling users’ needs and expectations.  5G Mobile Technology is about to drastically enhance these areas, especially in relation to security, augmented reality, and possibility of adding new functionalities.

Security: In regard to trusted computing, network slicing, or alternative methods to handle user identities.
New function possibility: The constraints of latency and speed will cease; this will allow a mobile development company to include easily new and unprecedented functionalities to the apps.
3D gaming and immersive augmented reality: Development related to these fast-emerging areas will be greatly influenced by 5G.

**Why is 5G Mobile Technology Considered Better Than Past and Prevailing Networks**

Lower latency that reduces interference and delay
Improved wireless power that allows more number of devices to connect on the IoT Network
Far faster fiber comparable speed in wireless mode
Improved opportunity for wireless connectivity
Greater range of coverage condition and option with uniform experienceMobile app development has been constantly moving toward creating complex and progressive apps in terms of design and functionalities.
