Java and Kotlin are the most-widely used development languages when it comes to Android App development. Professionals from any Android App Development Company, who have been making use of Java since very long, have another option now in Kotlin. Having been announced by Google as the second official language for developing Android Apps at the I/O conference, Kotlin has now emerged as one stellar programming language. No wonder, Kotlin offers to be compiled successfully and run effectively on the Java Virtual Machine. Java, having reigned as the most preferred language for developing Android apps, has found its match in Kotlin.

**The Open-Source Programming Language of the Recent Times – Kotlin**

While it is not compatible with Java, Kotlin, the powerful statically-typed programming language, runs on Java Virtual Machine. Code written using Kotlin works fine with Java as well as it natively does. Using aggressive inference for determination of the types of expressions and values – when they have not been stated clearly – Kotlin, as a programming language, is more distinctive than Java that at times may require repetitious type specifications.

After having been announced officially as a first-class Android Development language, Kotlin certainly has grabbed the attention of global Android App Development Companies and developers.

**Java or Kotlin – Making the Choice Becomes Tough**

Regardless of whether you are a beginner or expert, you are faced with the dilemma of deciding between Java and Kotlin today. With the additional choice, it is common that programmers and business owners alike find it a difficult task picking the right one for developing their Android Apps. It is by going through the various pros and cons related to both the programming languages that one will be able to arrive at the right decision in this connection.

**Pro-Java Factors – What Goes in Support of Java**

Android itself having been written in Java, there’s no wonder that Java has been many developers’ favorite with regard to [**Android App Development**](https://www.w2ssolutions.com/android-app-development/). This object-oriented programming language claims the title of the second most active language on GitHub. It has been around for nearly 20 years with its popularity only appearing to grow.

* Java proves easy to understand and learn
* Android App Development using Java is swift
* It offers great flexibility – allows reuse of code and regular updating of software
* Cross-platform apps can be conveniently developed using Java
* It has a large open source ecosystem
* Java apps tend to be compact and lighter; complex computing that is faced in Kotlin is avoided
* Java is highly adaptable with virtual machine or browser window, rendering itself to be smooth during updates and code reuse
* The app building process is considerably faster in Java than Kotlin
* Large projects can be easily handled with Java, thanks to Accelerated assembly with Gradle

**Glitches in Using Java for Android App Development**

* Limitations in Java may sometimes cause issues with Android API design
* Java, when compared with certain other programming languages, is slower
* It requires more memory
* More coding needed in Java renders it prone to bugs and errors
* Java faces certain issues such as endless try-catch blocks and Null Pointer Exception
* Null safety concerns and not being extendable are certain other issues
* Being an old version is a snag with Java
* What Makes Kotlin Gain Momentum in Contemporary

Being positioned as the first-class language for developing Android apps, Kotlin is considered to be the ‘enhanced Java’ by programmers across the globe. Kotlin provides several improvements over Java, its 2-decade old predecessor. Not without reason, Kotlin, the modern programming language offers a number of advantages, especially for building Android apps.

* Complete Java interoperability and compatibility with existing code is one major strong point of Kotlin
* Being clear, compact, and efficient, Kotlin has an intuitive and concise syntax – this leads to increased productivity
* Allowing for more stable code and reduced errors in production, Kotlin involves fewer bugs and requires reduced QA efforts and time
* Java to Kotlin switching is easy- it requires just installing Kotlin plugin and adding it to Gradle for conversion
* Smart extension functions available in Kotlin enable Android App Developers to build clean APIs
* Access to Anko Library is a major advantage offered by Kotlin
* It is easy to learn even if you have no prior mobile app development knowledge
* Kotlin is fully supported by Android Studio
* Reliable and precise codes enhance the security
* Kotlin excels over Java in regard to data classes
