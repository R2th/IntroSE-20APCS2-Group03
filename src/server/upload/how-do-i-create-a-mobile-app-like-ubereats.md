Freelance:

You can freelance someone to develop an app for you. This method is particularly helpful when you have some technical knowledge. Though the charges may depending upon various factors and quality of developers is not known.

Hire A Company:

You can hire a company to build an app for you. It is one of the simple ways to achieve your goal. You just need to ask for quotes and choose the best company to build your app. There are many apps and web development company to develop an app for your business.
