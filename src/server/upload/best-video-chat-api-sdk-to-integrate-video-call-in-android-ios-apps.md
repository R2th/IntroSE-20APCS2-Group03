The video call integration providers are basically of Saas based and Solution based.

 Let us get into a detailed view of the key differences of Saas and Solution based video call integration in Android, iOS and Web application. 

## Significant Difference Between SaaS-Based & Solution-Based Video Integrations

In some cases, both seem to provide the same video call functionality with the aid of video APIs and SDKs to make persistent video calls across the platforms. But, the facts hidden behind these two are, subscription-based concept and unlimited data usage based plan for integrating video call feature to make video calls over the internet.

Thus, the integration of video chat into the app is basically carried with the help of WebRTC signaling where the Saas based providers offer a peer-to-peer connection and the data usage is committed with monthly subscriptions. This kind of connectivity stops you from reaching more devices instantly.

## The Complete Working of Voice and Video Call Apps

Basically, media streaming is carried with help of WebRTC. Both the video and audio calls depend on the possibility of streaming between the two clients which are connected to each other. The process consist of three main servers namely: 

* Signaling
* STUN Server
* TURN Server

### Signaling:
In order to initiate the call between the servers that are connected to each other, both the client servers must confirm the connectivity by sending messages, key data, metadata. WebSockets is used for the purpose of signaling. 

### STUN Server:
Following the signaling, a peer to peer connection has to be made in order to obtain the Public IP address. In this case, a Public IP address is globally unique and exist on only one device.

There stands a Private IP address which is not globally unique and exist simultaneously on many devices. A Public IP Address can’t be connected directly to the internet. In this case, WebRTC requires a Public IP Address to connect peer-to-peer. Thus, STUN server provides both public IP addresses of clients to get connected through WebRTC and initiate the Call. 
If the case reaches to a point of not getting both clients Public IP address, then TURN server stands to make a peer-to-peer connection.

### TURN Server:
The TURN server is used to connect both the client servers in case if the peer-to-peer connection fails. The server acts as a mediator. The TURN server transmits the data from one client-server to another. Thus, it’s basic function is to relay the media. 

Let’s get into the technologies that have been the key factor in making persistent video calls over any platforms. Before digging deep into the actual understanding of technologies and features possessed in video call integration, let us take a quick look on one of the leading video chat app provider to the global market.
