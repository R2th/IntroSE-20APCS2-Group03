###  Architecture in magento
First of all, we need to know Magento is a great combination of Zend Framework with MVC (Model - View - Controller) architecture. With the use of magento, we can enumerate the advantages of the two models in developing applications on the basis of magento:

Inherit from Zend: With the inheritance from Zend, we can easily extend the application's classes to build, easily embed, and link to libraries. <! -
Inherit from the MVC model: It allows us to separate applications that need to evolve into three different components: Model, View, and Controller. Each component has a separate task and is independent of the other components. From there we can easily build and maintain the application as easily as possible.

**Directory structure in magento**

To develop the application on magento most easily, we first need to clearly understand each directory in Magento Framwork.
The following are the main magento directories that we need to understand during application development:
* 404 - Magento's 404 template and skin directory
* app - contains all the code (modules), template, configuration file, language. At the same time cure the theme, the default installation of the system
* downloader - Used to install and upgrade magento without using SSH
* js-contains the javascrip code
* lib - contains libraries of developers
* media - contains files uploaded to the system such as product images, documents ...
* pkginfo - contains information about the magento installation packages
* report - contains the reports that the system uses to report an error
* skin - contains css, image, javascrip files used to design themes, packages, templates
* var - where the files are stored. file cache, session, import, export data

**Module structure**

One module in magento has two main sections: "code" and "template".
* Code: Define the actions that the module will interact with the database.
* Template: The interface layout of the module based on code.
The template code consists of the following elements:
* Block: A place to load data, adjust data from the database before displaying data to the template.
* Controller: Obtaining a request from the user from http will then pass the request to the processing class.
* Etc: includes the xml file used to configure the module. Depending on the module, there are different xml files.
* Helper: We're going to put in the helper classes here. The functions we define in the helper can be called anywhere. So the helper is the place to hold "tools" to make your programming process easier in a certain way.
* Model: Place queries directly to the database.
* Sql: Include sql statements to create tables, interactively change data ...
