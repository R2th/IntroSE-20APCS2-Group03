With the increase in the demand for mobile applications, a large number of enterprises are shifting their focus towards mobile app development.

Introduction of new technologies, platforms, and frameworks is allowing mobile app developers to create revolutionary mobile apps.

Cross-Platform App Development has gained a lot of popularity in recent times as it enables developers to develop apps for multiple platforms like Android,  iOS, Windows with a single code base.

React Native is one of the most famous Cross Platform for mobile app development introduced by Facebook and it has one of the largest active developers community.

React is a JavaScript library which is efficient, flexible and declarative for developing user interfaces. It lets the developer compose complicated UIs of small and isolated pieces of code referred to as “components”.

## React features  
**Components** − It’ll assist you to maintain your code while working on large-scale projects. React is all about components.
**Unidirectional data flow and Flux** − React implements unidirectional data flow using Flux which is an application architecture that helps to keep your data unidirectional.   

## React Native UI components
React Native encourages you to build the UI of your application using isolated components. It is much easier to build applications using libraries and UI toolkits as it saves time and make development faster.

There are a lot of React Native UI components available to get started. Here, I am listing 11 React Native UI components that you should know. The list does not rank any framework and is listed in a random fashion.

Am I missing anything? Feel free to comment and add your own suggestions.
