## Problem

* When working with Database Management System liek SQL Server, mySQL, Oracle, ... You have the ability to modify many records even whole table at the same time. Regrettably, kintone does not provide that feature but you can still use a plugin in order to realize it.
***Plugin Bulk Update*** can update/ replace many records at the same time quickly, automatically. It also brings a friendly interface with end-users.  
So let's investigate how to use it practically.

## How to use Plug-in
**Bulk Update plugin Advantages**

Bulk Update 's developed to improve the updating data work better. Plugin supports 2 modes : Replace String and Update Data.
* With Replace String, you can search a term and then replace it with the word/number provided.

**Step by Step Tutorial**

* Please follow the last article (Plugin: Sum of Total Records) to install Plugin to your kintone App at first.
* After setting up successfully, you can use it freely depend on your needs.

### Replace String Mode Guide
Firstly, i would like to inform that, this mode only supports for the following fields:
* Text (Single Line Text)
* TextArea (Multi Line Text)

It also avoids some fields set:
* Calculation
* Reference to a look-up (destination of a lookup source field)

Let's take an example: Assuming that, I have a "Bulk Update" sample app.
