Healthcare app development companies must pay attention to welcoming a better way to increase patient care and the worthiness of their apps. Accessing patients to call doctors from app to any carrier network is the highest degree of a feature that a healthcare app could afford to patients with their apps.  

##  Smaller feature creates the Bigger Impact
Even though the real-time chat functionality is available in most of the healthcare apps, but the availability of sharing documents, images, x-rays, medical records to doctors within the same chat screen is a never-achievable to patients. Maintaining the healthcare app with conventional features isn’t going to help you drive engagement or revenue.
