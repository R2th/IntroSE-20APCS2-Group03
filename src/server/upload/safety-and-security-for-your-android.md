Between the hackers, phishing scams and malware, one would begin to think that all evil is out there trying to get your information and ruin your life. There is no one trick to completely protect yourself and your loved ones from these criminals.

There are measures you can take to prevent these acts from happening to you. There are top app development companies that design and create some phenomenal app that provides the safety and security you seek. Considering that the updates and security patches are generally not released soon enough, and even with the patches, there are still many attacks that still pop in.

There are many apps that will help protect you and your Android. Below we will list some of them that you can do research on and install on your devices if you choose. The best practices are to keep the device on regular update and research all apps before downloading onto your device. These criminal types find many ways to get around any security measures that you take, so avoiding these cute little quizzes you find on social media, ensure that you know all people that you add to your contact lists and keep your phone locked when you are not using it are just a few things to consider as a method to help keep your Android safe. This is not a situation that you should leave solely to the top app development companies and hope that the newest security app will work on your Android. You have to take the security measures to protect yourself also.

Only purchase from device vendors that do regular and timely updates.

When you are not using your phone, keep the screens locked so no one has access.

Utilize the two-step authentication process that is available for your Android.

Be sure to use the device encryption to eliminate those who think they can snoop

Use a Virtual Private Network instead of the free wi-fi that is available everywhere.

Only download or accept apps from trusted sources

Use passwords with numbers, letters, and symbols. Change the password routinely.

Turn off any connections when your device is not in use.

Install software for antivirus protection.

If there are apps on your phone that are no longer in use, uninstall them.

These are basic security measures that you can take to protect your device. They are simple to understand and do not take money each time to use. There are numerous other options that will help with security and safety for your Android. Again, top app development companies constantly strive to improve the apps they create to protect you and your information. Another routine measure everyone should take is to check the permissions on their devices. If there is no use, rescind the permission until the time you need to use the app.

When designing and creating, the trusted top app development companies instill many factors to aid in the security. Some of these include:

* Encryption
* Writing a secure code
* Using only authorized APIs
* They will use tamper-proof detection systems
* They test constantly
* Only the best in cryptography techniques and tools

With all the security breaches on technology as of late, using your ability to protect your device is the second best thing you can do after installing the antivirus programs and changing all passwords routinely. This will enable you to keep your information safe, encrypted and unavailable to the low lives that try to steal it.

Another action you should take routinely is to do a self-security check. Top app development companies create the apps for users, the user needs to be smart enough to deploy these apps.

As far as your lock screen, fingerprint security is one of the best measures to use. No two sets of fingerprints are identical, this will prevent break-ins on your device. Adding the find my device utility is a safety measure for those times if there will likely be no recovery of your phone. This utility will allow you to completely reset your phone so that no one could use it. This is a phenomenal tracking device for your phone.

There is also a measure to disable any unknown sources that you may have inadvertently given permission for in the past. This generally happens when a person is just messing around, looking at all the interesting things and accidentally accepts an unknown program.

On your Android, there are actions that are already in place for your benefit. Google Play Protect will routinely check on all apps and will send you notifications if they see any strange or odd behavior that can lead to security risks on your Android.

It is not as hard as one would think to keep your Android device safe. If you do regular checks and updates, uninstall any unknown or unused applications. Assist the top app development companies to help you in keeping the device secure. The top app developers work tirelessly to make the security just as important and necessary as the features themselves.

Cybersecurity will always tend to be a threat for us now, but if you take all precautions and follow the guidelines that are laid out by the [top software companies](https://topsoftwarecompanies.co) and your device's manufacturer, your information and safety will have no issues to worry about.

Remember, safety and security first! Playtime comes after. You should be the only one using your phone, not some hacker on the streets.
