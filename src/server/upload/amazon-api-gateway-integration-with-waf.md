This pattern in CDK offers a example to generate an Amazon API Gateway with a greedy proxy ("{proxy+}") and "ANY" method from the specified path, meaning it will accept by default any method and any path. The VPC Lambda function provided in JavaScript only returns the path.

* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) (AWS CDK) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory its source code folder:
    ```bash
      cd apig-waf/src
    ```
3. From the command line, use npm to install the development dependencies:
    ```bash
      npm install
    ```
4. To deploy from the command line use the following:
    ```bash
      npx cdk bootstrap aws://accountnumber/region
      npx cdk deploy --app 'ts-node .' --all
    ```

## Testing


  *  Locate WAFAPIGatewayApi.ApiUrl from output printed by cdk, this is the api endpoint to be invoked
    In a browser

    ```https://<api_id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod```

    You should see: ```Success path: "/"```



## Cleanup
 
1. From the command line, use the following in the source folder
    ```bash
    npx cdk destroy --app 'ts-node .' --all
    ```
2. Confirm the removal and wait for the resource deletion to complete.
