## HOW TO RUN

#### (last updated on 4/11/2022 by R2th)

## FIRST

Try to run `git pull` to pull the latest version in the repository

or run `git pull origin main` to pull the latest version for the branch 'main'

## IF HAVE ANYTHING TO UPDATE

You should run `npm i` to install all the modules needed

## THEN

You need run `npm run postinstall` to link all module alias of the src directory

Now you can start the project by running `npm start`

### IF HAVE ANYTHING PROBLEM,

- PLEASE contact me (`R2th`) as soon as possible

### BEFORE YOUR WORKING TASK,

- PLEASE DO NOT EDIT in `main` branch!!!

- PLEASE checkout in ANOTHER branch and `{branch_name}` will have format

  - `{YOUR NAME}_{ID (if have)}_{SHORTEN_TASK_NAME}`

  - You could try `git checkout -b {branch_name}` to create and switch to that branch

### END OF WORKING,

- PLEASE PUSH THE BRANCH AND PULL REQUEST IF NEEDED (contact me to accept your request)
