## HOW TO RUN

#### (last updated on 4/11/2022 by R2th)

## FIRST

Try to run `git pull` to pull the latest version in the repository

or run `git pull origin main` to pull the latest version for the branch 'main'

## IF HAVE ANYTHING TO UPDATE

You should run `npm i` to install all the modules needed

## THEN

You need run `npm run postinstall` to link all module alias of the src directory

Now you can start the project by running `npm start`
